            <h2>Tim Ballard</h2>
            <p>As a former Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security(DHS), Tim Ballard spent more than a
                decade assigned to the Internet
                Crimes Against Children(ICAC) Task Force. During his time with the ICAC, Tim was deployed with the U.S.
                Child Sex Toursim Jump Team
                as an undercover operative.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working in Task Force ICAC, he has seen all types of cases in the war to take down child
                trafficking rings. He's worked in both the
                United States and a handful of foreign countries, infiltrating and combatting child trafficking
                organizations. Mr. Ballard and his teams have successfully disrupted and dismantled dozens of
                the trafficking organizations and rescued children from explotation and slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his time working for the government and DHS, Ballard realized there was much more that needed to
                be
                accomplished in the fight against child trafficking organizations. This led to the exodus of Tim and a
                team
                of his fellow operatives in 2013 from the DHS, to then accomplish this monumental task as a private
                foundation---Operation Underground Railroad(O.U.R.) </p>

            <h2>Leading the fight against child sex trafficking</h2>
            <p>As a private foundation, the team at Operation Underground Railroad can work in any jurisdiction in
                cooperation with law
                enforcement to directly rescue children. This team is currently still active today and operating
                all over the world. Not only does O.U.R. provide critical resources to law enforcement to both prevent
                and thwart child explotation,
                they also provide aftercare for rescued children by helping them find families through adoption. Tim
                Ballard and his wife have nine children, two of which were adopted after
                being rescued. </p>
            <p>The fight against child trafficking continues today, as millions of children have gone missing. Over
                800,000 children go missing
                each year in the United States alone. Tim Ballard and multiple operatives are hard at work helping lead
                the fight against these awful child trafficking and explotation rings.
                It is up to us to help spread the word, protect, and save the most important part of our future:
                Children.
